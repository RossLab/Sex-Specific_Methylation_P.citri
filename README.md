# Sex Specific DNA Methylation in *Planococcus citri*.
Repository for all code used in the pre-print XXX. 

Each folder contains numbered scripts representing the sequence in which the scripts were executed. Scripts are then also grouped by letters if appropriate, e.g. A01.script and A02.script belong to the same pipeline.

## Project Structure and Scripts
**Alternative_splicing_etc**
Sex-specific alternative splicing events and identification of sex-biased, extremely sex-biased and sex limited genes. These scripts are based on Stevie's RSEM counts.
**Differential_methylation**
Full pipeline using whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from fastqc to differential methylation identification between sexes. It also includes annotation of differentially methylated sites. 
**GO_analysis**
GO enrichment analysis of gene sets.
**Genome_formating_and_extra_annotations**
Creation of putative promotors, intron annotation, exon 1-3 annotation and intergenic annotation. Also a script for calculating the number of CpGs per given annotation.
**Methylation_paired_with_expression**
Relationship of methylation with general expression, differential expression and alternative splicing. 
**Methylation_proxies**
Annotation of CpG islands.
**Motif_enrichment_HOMER**
Identification of enriched motifs for methylation and unmethylation annotations.
**Transposable_elements**
De novo annotation of transposable elements in *P. citri*.
