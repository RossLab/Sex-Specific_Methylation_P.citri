# De novo transcriptome assembly

Here I make a de novo transcriptome assembly from the male and female RNA-Seq data in order to better annotate alternative splicing. (This was suggested by reviewers).

Following Andr√©s's pipeline found [here](https://github.com/RossLab/B_viburni/blob/master/2_Transcriptome.md).
